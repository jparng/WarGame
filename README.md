# WarGame
Game of War card game developed by a team of 3 following a software development lifecycle.

# Scope Statement

  For our group project, we have decided to create a card game called War. The general idea of the game involves each player holding a deck of a set amount of cards. Each player will draw and flip over their top card. Whoever’s card has the higher value, that player will take all those cards and add it to their “spoils” pile. If there is a tie, then one card will be drawn and placed face down. The next card drawn will decide who wins all the cards. If a player runs out of cards, but has cards won from previous “battles”, the cards will be shuffled and put into the player’s deck. The winner is decided when only one player has all the cards.  

  This game will work in Windows and will act as a standalone game that will not require an internet connection. The game will likely make use of images to display the cards and a class to randomize the cards collected when the initial deck runs out of cards. We will also need to use some frameworks– such as Swing and AWT for Java– to create a graphical user interface for the game. The game will support at least 2 players and will also support a computer as well. The programming language that we will use will be Java. The game will also use a graphical interface to show the cards in play. Sound effects will be played for certain in game actions such as shuffling, winning a game, or losing.
